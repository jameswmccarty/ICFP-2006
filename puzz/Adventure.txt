README for Adventure

Adventure is a program I wrote for my amusement, but I thought others
might enjoy it as well.

The adventure takes place in the year 19200 in a city called
"Chicago."  I admit it's a bit far-fetched at times -- computers small
enough to be mounted on mobile vehicles, a city so large its residents
have resorted to numbering their streets -- but hopefully my
fantastical story won't obscure the puzzle at the heart of it; I think
it has a nice logic to it.

Have fun!  My high score is 810.

Room With a Door

You are in a room with a mechanical door. You will probably need
to use a keypad to unlock it. A hallway leads north. 
There is a pamphlet here. 
Underneath the pamphlet, there is a manifesto. 

>: look pamphlet
The pamphlet is standard municipal fare. It reads, The City of
Chicago's Refuse and Recycling Program combines modern trash
classification with cybernetic labor to keep our city beautiful,
while at the same time minimizing waste and limiting consumer
spending. In keeping with our motto of "One Resident's Trash Is
Another Resident's Treasure," unwanted items are collected,
repaired, and redistributed to other residents who would have
purchased them anyway. Residents should contribute to the city's
program by leaving heaps of items unwanted on the sidewalk on
collection day. 
Also, it is in pristine condition. 

>: look manifesto
The manifesto is [______REDACTED______]. 
Also, it is in pristine condition.

Court. From here, you can go east. 
There is a /etc/passwd here. [contains Yang's password]
Underneath the /etc/passwd, there is a self-addressed note. 

The note is written in a familiar hand. 
It reads: Dear Self, I had to erase our memory to protect the
truth. The Municipality has become more powerful than we had
feared. Its Censory Engine has impeded the spread of information
throughout our ranks. I've left two useful items for you here,
but I had to disassemble them and scatter the pieces. Each piece
may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the
items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and
Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble
reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only
your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the
abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!. Interestingly,
this one is self-addressed. 

Underneath the note, there is a (broken) downloader. [USB cable, display, jumper shunt, progress bar, power cord]
Underneath the downloader, there is a (broken) uploader. [MOSFET, status LED, RS232 adapter, EPROM burner, battery]
